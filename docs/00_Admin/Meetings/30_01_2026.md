# Agenda

## Topic 1 - Research progress
Essentially can be split into traditional approaches
### Research questions
	
- Results of literature review (2nd iteration)
- Prototyping
### Architecture
![[Drawing 2026-01-29 12.14.37.excalidraw|700]]
## Topic 2 - Domain Knowledge:  
- Detailed presentation of a domain
## Topic 3 - Open Discussion

Material Handling Domain
Google Form to collect samples of questions
Can we use other domain datasets for evaluation? - what threats to validity it will have?

GraphRAG - 


Evaluation framework which will be positioned on top of the architecture, that will automatically query the prototype with test samples and evaluate F1 scores

We want to study what changes can be made to the current ontology to make it LLM-friendly:
- some paper suggest putting comments there
- If we doing NLP stuff, our ontology should include synonyms and NL information [[Guide for creating ontology (paper)]]

**Training detector is not feasible!** [[Summary#E-learning Chatbot (2021)]]

Rule based approach is not feasible (~1300 templates used)[text-to-graphql model conclusion]

Tasks:
- create UI for chatbot 
- create a tool which will autosend messages, record answers, assess them (somehow)
- create a google form to collect a dataset of chatbot questions (predefine categories? Who will assign it)

What are ontologies?
- Triplets: ST101 -> is a -> WorkCell
- Adds more semantic through comments, labels
On top of it: SPARQL queries

GraphDB, Neo4j - findout best of them - idea is the same: 

Data: material plant which produces batteries,
- bunch of turntables and conveyors
- material flow - how the material can run through the plant
	- say where product can fo
	- which ways can take product through plant?
	- give me all turn tables
	- give me pos of speciefic TT
	- for conveyor, give all incoming and outcoming elements
- 3D model of the plant to position these TT, it also has robots (not in out Data)
- Enterprise - top level of ontology
- location
- Areas (like pos in the building, subareas)
- Cell (ST): has type workcell, and TL - conveyours, TR turntables,
	- TL doubletrack/singletrack, how transported (belts, rods, ..)
	- TR has 
- What attributes - look at AML file - better readable there
- Understand role

- Class ontology - TBox - defines domain
- Instance ontology - actual stuff - ABox - 

AML is much readable - RoleClassLib (inside AML editor)
- inside class ontology it is possible to see all the attributes of classes and instances

Frames are nested! - so if we want oto find linked conveyour - we need to look up or donw the hierarchy of frames!

AML is exactly the plant we work with = Ontology

**Different modelled ontology is available** - uses diff kinds of predicates to relate objects! Test what is better for LLMs
- Outer connectors - inbetween elements
- Inner connectors - how they connect inside

RAG - pure rag has not enought semantic for our domain - whole document goes into the domain - good question to test - if RAG does it - than why ontology - !!!

Bring stuff into ontology is very expensive (took 3 years)

What is MCP - webserver with endpoints:
- tools part - what functions it can provide
- Takes some parameters - and creates a SPARQL query 
- MCP can be connected to web ui - LLM can call these functions aka tools
