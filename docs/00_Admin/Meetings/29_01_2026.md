### Team meeting

### Agenda
[[Guide for creating ontology (paper)]]
We need example questions / tasks for our chatbot!!!
We need to define limits of our domain
Can ontology be modified in the future?
We need to understand what data might be relevant to our potential user => we need to know our potential user

We need to provide comments to help LLM/RAG capture meaning of RDF concepts - basically its their conclusion [[Summary#Industry 4.0 Chatbot (2024)]]


Do we need some interface to record questions dataset? Also classify intent?
**Training detector is not feasible!** [[Summary#E-learning Chatbot (2021)]]


If we doing NLP stuff, our ontology should include synonyms and NL information [[Guide for creating ontology (paper)]]

Looks like we need to reverse engineer our ontology so we can understand what Tina wants from us
(if she will not give us proper info)

- use SPARQL +RDF & OWL or Cypher + Neo4j?
	- What tool captures our data structure the best?

Tasks:
- create UI for chatbot 
- create a tool which will autosend messages, record answers, assess them (somehow)
- create a google form to collect a dataset of chatbot questions (predefine categories? Who will assign it)
- We need research questions and fast!
