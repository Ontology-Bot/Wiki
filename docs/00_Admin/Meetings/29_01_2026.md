### Team meeting

### Agenda
We need example questions / tasks for our chatbot!!!
We need to define limits of our domain
Can ontology be modified in the future?
We need to understand what data might be relevant to our potential user => we need to know our potential user

Do we need some interface to record questions dataset? Also classify intent?
**Training detector is not feasible!**


If we doing NLP stuff, our ontology should include synonyms and NL information

Looks like we need to reverse engineer our ontology so we can understand what tina wants from us
(if she will not give us proper info)

- use SPARQL +RDF & OWL or Cypher + Neo4j?
	- What tool captures our data structure the best?
