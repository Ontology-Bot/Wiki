# E3 — Engineering Data to Ontology Mapping (AutomationML)

**Paper:**  
Automatic Mapping of AutomationML Files to Ontologies (2025)  
https://arxiv.org/html/2504.21694v2

## Focus

Semantic integration of engineering data into ontology-based knowledge graphs.

## Core Idea

AutomationML models are automatically transformed into RDF/OWL representations, enabling SPARQL querying and semantic validation.

## Architecture

AutomationML → Ontology Mapping → RDF Triples → GraphDB → SPARQL

## Key Contributions

- Provides a declarative mapping from AutomationML to ontologies.
- Enables querying and validation of engineering data using Semantic Web technologies.
- Uses SHACL constraints to validate structural and semantic correctness.

## Evaluation

- Validates correctness of transformed models using SHACL.
- Demonstrates feasibility on industrial engineering standards.

## Relevance

Provides the data foundation required for chatbot-based querying approaches and serves as a blueprint for future ECAD integration.
